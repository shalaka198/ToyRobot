Assumptions
---------------
- User input is not constrained to be uppercase
- User input is can include whitespace; my app removes and whitespace and capitalises instruction before proceeding to next steps
- Wherever user provides invalid instruction, my app ignores it
- Board is considered to be square and dimension is set to 5 but this is configurable in config file
